# QR-RideAssist

QR-RideAssist is a backend for an auto booking app that enables users to book a cab by scanning a dynamically generated QR code. This project provides a seamless experience for both riders and drivers in the process of hailing and providing rides.

## Demo and Documentation

- A live version of this project is deployed on a free instance at Render and can be accessed at: [https://rideassist.onrender.com/api/v1/drivers/test](https://rideassist.onrender.com/api/v1/drivers/test)
- Detailed backend documentation can be found at: [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9600373/2s93eSZas9](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9600373/2s93eSZas9)

## Getting Started

To run the QR-RideAssist backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Please note: Before running the application, make sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string as `mongoPath="dummy connection path"`. The connection string should start with something like `mongodb+srv...`.
